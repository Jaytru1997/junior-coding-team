# Introduction

This is a current homepage and information hub owned by Junior Coding Team members. Here you can find information around participating in upcoming challenges and projects within our junior coding group. Includes ticketing &amp; planning tools, important links and a set of rules required for a successful merge of your PR.

## TECHNOLOGY AND LANGUAGES USED

At the moment the idea is to use your regular HTML/CSS/JS and build up education and environmental resources with a purpose of solving problems using basic technologies.

#### Experience level:

- Beginner/Trainee/Junior

#### Skills we're looking for:

- UI / UX / Front End / Design / Research / Socials / Planning & Organising Skills /

## Main place we use to chat and vote:

Our main communication tool is WONDR platform. This is where we keep all our documents and important information, meeting summaries, tutorials and guides. WONDR Messenger is what we use to chat, ask questions and keep up with other team members. You can use it in the browser or you can download an app to your phone. You can join us by visiting this invite link here: https://mywondr.co/profile/view/cdd60d10-7ac3-11eb-b163-1fd52740df0d/?invite=1

In the past we used to use discord as our main communication tool but since our switch to WONDR weâ€™ve removed duplicated channels and only use Discord for audio/video/screen sharing meetings. One of those is our Friday Focus Session which happens every Friday at 7PM UK time and is advertised on WONDR as an event - which you can save to your calendars. You can join us by visiting this invite link here: https://discord.com/invite/HgFaYYADRC

## Current Projects - Team Page / Sleep Calculator / Palmadillo Browser Game / CAT Match /

Team Page - Team Page is the very first project started by our Junior Developer Group, hosted on GitHub Pages. This is a current homepage and information hub owned by Junior Coding Team members.

Sleep Calculator - Sleep Quality Calculator is the second project started by our Junior Developer Group, hosted on GitHub Pages. 'Sleep Quality Calculator' is an open source project using vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the time being. Learn about the benefits and side effects of poor sleep quality, calculate your own sleep quality score and share additional resources where one can find help or further answers.

Palmadillo Browser Game - This is a first browser game developed by Junior Developer Group. As the name says, the game is inspired by Tamagotchi mechanics but it focuses on bringing awareness to an endangered animal, Pink Fairy Armadillo - the star of our project.

CAT Match - Our first project using an API which returns information on different cat breeds. The idea is to help you find your perfect cat breed using the cat API and Matchbox API
